      "\\noindent Contemporary {\\textquotedblleft}sound-based{\\textquotedblright} music presents rich opportunities for semantic study: in attenuating note-based organization, such music shifts the nexus of association from conventional musical units such as melodies onto properties such as timbre and texture. Metaphorical associations in such cases may consist in acoustical-to-semantic cross-domain mappings explicable through acoustical analysis. [P] In a perceptual experiment, 38 participants rated 40 excerpts of contemporary music along 23 semantic scales, e.g., rating the extent to which the music suggested {\\textquotedblleft}machinery,{\\textquotedblright} or seemed {\\textquotedblleft}kaleidoscopic.{\\textquotedblright} Significant consistency was observed between participants in associating these semantic domains with musical excerpts. Excerpts that were rated highly for the same semantic scales tended to have similar musical properties (e.g., {\\textquotedblleft}kaleidoscopic{\\textquotedblright} excerpts tended to be timbrally heterogeneous and internally dynamic). More precise descriptions of the stimuli were sought through acoustical analyses. [P] Summary statistics of classical acoustical timbre descriptors were computed and correlated with ratings through multiple linear regressions, but these explained only a small proportion of the variance. An alternate, data-driven approach was adopted to fit mathematical distances between neuromimetic representations such as Spectro-Temporal Receptive Fields to those between human ratings, yielding robust correlations between the two. However, it remains unclear what acoustical information contained in this representation contributes to the simulation of human ratings. A complementary approach was provided by a model of cochlear and mid-level processing of sound textures based on summary statistics. The model allows for resynthesis of a given texture based on its measured statistics, confirming that the model captures the relevant acoustical information. However, it has proven to be more effective for some kinds of musical textures than others, a subject of ongoing investigation. [P] Through initial analyses with classical audio descriptors followed by alternative approaches with neuromimetic models, we have made first steps towards understanding how subjects map acoustically rich, sound-based musical textures onto semantic domains.\n",
