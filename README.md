# Conference_programfiles_SMPC2019
Python 2.7, data, and LaTeX files for generating various forms of the SMPC 2019 schedule and program. For future reference and in case anyone wants to borrow the formating. Note: the data files contain the same information as posted in various forms in the final publications for the conference, except that the email addresses have been deliberately corrupted.

Generated documents can be found on the 2019 meeting of the Society of Music Perception and Cognition website: https://wp.nyu.edu/smpc2019/
